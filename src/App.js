          <p className="info">Hey, great to see you here.  I have been working since the past 9 months as the product manager for IMIâ€™s bot building platform for enterprises, which serves the likes of a major furniture retail store in the UK and a large government organization in Dubai. My tech and design understanding helps me balance feasibility and user needs</p>
          <p className="info">I was <b>previously a designer</b> entrusted with the creation of a seamless experience for building bots within IMI. I helped my team build a consistent interface by adapting an existing design system to fit user and business needs.</p>
          <p className="info">I graduated from <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</b> in 2018 with a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am in the active pursuit of heist novels, movies and television shows. I love to cook appetizers and play hindi songs on my ukulele to unwind.</p>
          <p className= "info">I also build small, random web apps with React and Express JS, while I prefer to use python for small experiments. I also am learning how system design works and how enterprises take business decisions.</p>
          <p className="info">Feel free to reach out to me at <a className="email" href="mailto:dilippitchika@gmail.com">dilippitchika@gmail.com</a></p>
